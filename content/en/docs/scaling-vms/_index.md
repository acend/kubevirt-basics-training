Similar to regular container Pods there are cases when we want to have multiple instances of the same VM running. In this section
we will have a look how KubeVirt supports this.


## Lab Goals

* Know how to use VirtualMachine Pools
* Know the difference for ephemeral VMs and VMs requiring persistent storage
* Create and use a pool
