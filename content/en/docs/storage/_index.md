---


In this section we focus on attaching storage volumes provided by kubernetes storage drivers to our virtual machines.
We also have a look at hot plugging and resizing disks.


## Lab Goals

* Mount storage as disks or filesystems
* Use filesystem and block devices
* Mount ConfigMaps and secrets
* Hot plugging storage
* Resizing disks
